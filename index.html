        <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The client-server model has been in use for around 60 years, but over the past two decades, the idea of serverless computing has become feasible and popular. In case you aren't familiar with serverless computing, allow ChatGPT to explain: "Serverless computing? More like 'server-less headaches.' It's not truly 'serverless' because, surprise, servers still exist! You're just off the hook for babysitting them. Think of it more as 'servers on demand' with a fancy billing twist." While not babysitting servers sounds great, most people would prefer not getting billed for the pleasure. In this paper, we will investigate "free serverless", also known as serverless at home. </p>
Â  Â  Â  Â  <h2>Methods</h2>
Â  Â  Â  Â  <h3>Hosting</h3>
Â  Â  Â  Â  <h3>WASM</h3>
Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  <p>Perhaps a more intuitive definition of serverless would be one where there simply is no server (outside of the server hosting the html files). At first, this definition may sound too restrictive to have interesting websites, but by using web assembly (WASM) and javascript we can make the client run all the code to make our site interesting. We've shown this functionality with our previous SIGBOVIK entry: <a href="ringfuck.html">Ringfuck</a>. While WASM makes creating interesting websites pretty easy, javascript psychopaths have been doing the same thing for years without it. </p>
Â  Â  Â  Â  <h3>CI/CD</h3>
Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  <p>If we want true serverless at home, we need to be able to replicate the functionality of database-driven websites for free. To do this, we turn back to Github and its most recent feature (besides stealing everyone's code to train a Kamikaze CoPilot) CI/CD, or Github Actions as they call it. Github's CI/CD allows you to write a custom bash script to be run in a Docker container. This allows us to edit our html with simple CLI tools like cat, echo, sed, and awk and then commit those changes back to the repo. The final step is to simply trigger the CI/CD to run when a user performs an action requiring a server operation. To perform this, we use some simple javascript along with a Github auth token to push a change to the repo, then query the Github API to determine when the change has finished so that we can automatically refresh the page.</p>
Â  Â  Â  Â  <h2>Security and Privacy</h2>
Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  <p>While there are security concerns with this serverless at home methodology, a lot of potential security issues are shared with other applications that accept user input, so we will not be discussing these. A unique issue with our CI/CD approach is the need for a publicly accessible Github auth token. To mitigate this risk, it is recommended to use a fine-grained access token for the specific repository. The major downside to this is that the token must have an expiration date, thus creating some maintenance. To avoid maintenance, you could create a dummy account with a classic access token, but this would allow anyone to attempt changes on public repos with your dummy account.</p>
<p>On the privacy front, there are a couple of unique issues with serverless at home. First is the classic git problem of it being very difficult to permanently delete content that was committed. Thus, any sensitive data in a comment will remain visible to everyone until an administrator removes it, which may never happen since owners of github repos are notoriously picky about other people changing their precious code. The next concern regards user sessions. While it is possible to have the CI/CD system create user sessions by creating subdirectories and deleting them later, these sessions would be viewable by anyone interested enough to pull up the source code. Since this is not easily mitigatable, our recommendation is to simply inform the users of your site that they have <b>no privacy</b>. So if you've read this far, congratulations you've been informed.</p>
Â  Â  Â  Â  <h2>Comparison to Traditional Serverless</h2>
Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  <p>Traditional hosting and serverless are a pretty polished experience for devs and users, especially compared to serverless at home. So why would you ever use serverless at home? One selling point is the fact that it is totally free, as long as you don't have a bunch of users, which shouldn't be a big concern for most readers. Some people would argue there are better free alternatives, like Wordpress. Which brings us to our next selling point: freedom. Services like Wordpress might be free, but they restrict what you can do with your site to try to get you to pay for more freedom. But with serverless at home, as long as you can code it to run when the Github Action triggers, you're free to do it. Finally, the biggest reason to use serverless at home is so that you can deliver an aweful user experience to your "friend" when they ask you to make a "simple" website for them.</p>
Â  Â  Â  Â  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  <p>Is serverless at home revolutionary? No, but that would be funny.</p>
